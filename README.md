# SleepyMemo
A memo that records the knowledge I've learned

When we've learned a knowledge. We'll forget it if we did not review it for a while. But when we want to bring it back. We will figure out there's no a good memo for the quick review. It's also a hard thing to transfer your knowledge to others.

So I decide to make a ppt while I'm in learning. It will make the knowledge more solid and it's also a good memo for future review, and for transfer.

So let's do it.
